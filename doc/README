About XHSI
==========
XHSI is an add-on for the X-Plane flight simulator (http://www.x-plane.com). It recreates an Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) display used in todays commercial jet airplanes with so called glass cockpits. 

XHSI is a standalone Java application that is driven by X-Plane via network. It can run on the same machine as X-Plane (using the loopback adapter) or can run on another machine to distribute the processing load. Right now, XHSI is young and hence still somewhat ressource hungry. 

XHSI receives its data from X-Plane with a dedicated plugin XHSIPlugin<OS>.xpl. So far, only Mac (PPC and Intel) and Windows plugins are available. I don't plan on building a Linux version myself but I'll publish the plugin sources and hope someone with Linux will help me out here.

XHSI is free software and is published under the GNU General Public License.

XHSI is still in beta state so a lot of things need to and will be improved and added. If you find bugs or have suggestions, please let me know - I am looking forward to your feedback. You can reach me best under mailto:gruetter@users.sorceforge.net or post a comment on http://www.g16g.de.

Updates and release planning information will be available under http://www.g16g.de/x-plane/.

System requirements
===================
- Mac OS X (PPC or Intel) or Windows XP
- Java Runtime Environment 1.5.0 or higher
- X-Plane 8.10 or higher

Installation
============
1. Shut down X-Plane if it is running
2. Copy the XHSIPluginMac.xpl or XHSIPluginWin.xpl into X-Planes plugin folder (".../X-Plane/Ressources/plugins/")
3. Copy XHSI.jar and XHSI.properties to the machine on which you want to run the HSI
4. Run XHSI.jar by double clicking on XHSI.jar or, in case your system is configured otherwise, open a command line, switch to the directory in which XHSI.jar resides and type: java -jar XHSI.jar
5. If installed XHSI for the first time or overwrote your old configuration file (XHSI.properties), you need to set the X-Plane path. Open the XHSI - Preferences menu and enter the path to the X-Plane home directory here. Alternatively, click on Browse in the preferences dialog and locate the X-Plane home directory via Finder/Explorer.

That's it. 

You can verify the correct installation of the X-Plane plugin in the plugins menu of X-Plane. You should see an entry called XHSI. You can also view the detailed plugin information sheet under "Plugins/Plugin Admin/Plugin Information ". Here you should see the entry "XHSI Plugin 1.0 Beta 1 (Enabled)".

To verify the XHSI appliation runs correctly, double click the XHSI.jar and verify it starts up. If XHSI found your X-Plane installation and imported navigation databases, the statusbar shows the "NAV DB" icon. If XHSI could not load the databases, this icon is crossed out. Update the path in the preferences dialog in this case.

If you still experience problems, activate logging in XHSIs preferences menu. Set the logging level to "Finest". Consult the logfile XHSI.log, that is created in the same directory that XHSI.properties resides in.

Operation
=========
Once XHSI and the XHSI plugin are installed, you can operate them as follows:
1. run XHSI on the target machine
2. run X-Plane. The plugin is enabled and configured to send data to an XHSI instance running on the same machine (destination IP = "127.0.0.1") per default. Edit the destination IP in the plugins preferences menu and click set to control an XHSI instance running on another machine. Enable or disable the plugin via X-Planes Plugin - Enable/Disable menu.

Make sure that UDP traffic from X-Planes machine to the machine running XHSI is not blocked by a firwall. Per default, XHSI uses port 49001.
